# Future Gadget #16: Luminous Rhythm Emitter
## DIY Penlight project
This project is a work in progress! This current version is untested, but should work in theory, based on my experience with the previous versions. Use and build at your own risk! No guarantees given.
This project aims to create an open-source homemade penlight for various concerts (J-Pop, Idols, VTuber, Vocaloid) that can be controlled remotely. You'll need access to a 3D printer and equipment for soldering SMD parts. You'll have to order a PCB, based on the KiCad design provided in the `Circuits` folder, as well as some electronic parts. The `3D` folder contains the stl files for 3D printing. A parts list will be located in the `Circuits` folder.
